"""Smart Team Planning: recommends how to plan field-team assignments for
P0 tickets, ahead of time - "today" mode for morning planning (matches the
same P0 definition every other tab in this app uses), "tomorrow" mode for
night-time planning (one reference point further out, showing what WILL
be P0 by tomorrow night before it happens).

Combines three things:
1. Live ticket data (same REALTIME_SHEET_ID sheet every other tab already
   reads), classified against whichever reference point the chosen
   planning mode uses.
2. Team/Skill assignment, matched from the external GGS "Daily" sheet by
   TICKETID == Source Ticket ID or External TicketID - reuses
   mateline_status.fetch_ggs_daily_rows() directly (same sheet+tab that
   module already reads/caches for the Status Mateline feature, so this
   doesn't add a second read of the same data). Also used to total up
   each team's OVERALL current workload (every row assigned to them,
   regardless of severity/group), for context next to the P0 count.
3. Each ticket's own LATITUDE/LONGITUDE/PROVINCE/DISTRICT/SUBDISTRICT
   (already present on every ticket row in REALTIME_SHEET_ID - no separate
   site-coordinate master needed).
